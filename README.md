# ServiceFabricQueuing
A queuing pub/sub service (aka simple Service Bus Topics), fully implemented on ServiceFabric)

This project is used by / based/derived from the job we made at TED HackWeek 2017 project with the PubSub project team  https://github.com/brentstineman/ServiceFabricPubSub

I use this repos to test new concept, ideas and architecture for topic/subscriber services before merging with the main project.
