# ServiceFabricQueueing
A Service Fabric queuing service (like Azure Storage Queue or Service Bus), fully implemented on ServiceFabric)

This project is based/derived from the job we made at TED HackWeek 2017 project https://github.com/brentstineman

Used to test new concept and architecture before merging with the main project.
