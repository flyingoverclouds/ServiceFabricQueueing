# ServiceFabricQueueing
A Service Fabric queuing service (like Azure Storage Queue or Service Bus), fully implemented on ServiceFabric)

This project is based/derived from the job we made at TED HackWeek 2017 project https://github.com/brentstineman/ServiceFabricPubSub

I use this repos to test new concept and architecture for topic/subscriber services before merging with the main project.
